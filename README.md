# React Stock Tracker

Welcome to the **React Stock Tracker** project! This application is built using modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, and Ant Design to provide an interactive and visually appealing experience for traders.

This app uses the API https://finnhub.io to display stock related info.

I wanted to experiment with this new library called Jotai for state management. I had a really good experience working with this library.
